        <h2>Analysis and Finding</h2>
        <img src="reservation status count.jpg" alt="Reservation staus count for cancelled and not cancelled bookings">
        <p class = "paraimg">
            The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservation that are canceled and
            those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations
            that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled their reservation,
            which has a significant impact on the hotel's earnings.
        </p>

        <p>
            In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. it is possible
            that resort hotels are expensive than those in city hotel.
        </p>

        <img src="average daily rate in city hotels and resort hotels.jpg" alt="Average daily rates in city hotel and resort hotel">
        <p>
            The line graph shows that on certain days, the average daily rate for city hotel is less
            than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without saying 
            that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.
        </p>
        
        <img src="reservation status per month.jpg" alt="Reservation Status per Month">
        <p>
            We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with highest and lowest
            reservation levels according to the reservation status. As can ve seen, both the largest
            in the month of  August wheras January is the month with the most cancelled reservations.
        </p>

        <img src="adr per month.jpg" alt="Average daily Rate for Each month">
        <p>
            The bar graph demostrates that canellations are most common when prices are
            gratest and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the 
            accomodation is solely responible for cancellations.
        </p>

        <img src="top 10 coutries with reservation canceled.jpg" alt="Top 10 coutries with reservation canceled">
        <p>
            Now, we see which country has the highest reservation canceled from the pie chart.
             The top country is Portugal with about 70% of reservation canceled.
        </p>

        <img src="percetage of hotel bookings made from different agents.jpg" alt="Percentage of hotel bookings that are made from agents">
        <p>
            Now we check the area from where the guest are making hotel reservation requests.
            <br>We can see that almost 47% of the guest makes hotel reservation from onlint travel agents.
            <br>From offline travel agents,  there are almost 19% of reservation.
            <br>Only 4% make reservation directly by going to the hotels.
        </p>

        <img src="adr from 2016 to 2017.jpg" alt="average daily rate graph ">
        <p>
            As seen in the graph above, reservation are canceled when the average daily rate higher than 
            when it is not canceled.It clearly proves the above analysis that higher price leads to higher 
            cancelations.

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
        <ol >
            <li><p>
                Cancellation rates rise as the prices does. In order to prevent cancellation
                of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower
                the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also povide some discount
                to the customers.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                As the ratio of the  cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel
                is higher than city hotels. So, the resort hotel should provide a resonable
                discount on the rooms prices on weekends or on holidays.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a resonable
                amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in the month.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                They can also increase the quality of their hotels and thier services mainly in 
                Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
            </p></li>
